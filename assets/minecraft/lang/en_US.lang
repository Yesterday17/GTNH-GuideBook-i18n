#Quest_0.Your first night
gtnh.quest0.name=Your first night
gtnh.quest0.desc=Your first task will be to find food, and a shelter for the night. The nights will be cruel, as this pack has hardcore darkness. It probably would be a good idea to collect some food now...

#Quest_1.Where is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.name=Where is the flint?
gtnh.quest1.desc=As you might have noticed, while collecting gravel, no flint dropped for you. Well, there is a... recipe for that. Look up flint in NEI and craft some!

#Quest_2.Sticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.name=Sticks 'n Stones
gtnh.quest2.desc=This book has a built-in reading light, lucky you! Most probably you will read this text while you are waiting for the night to be over. Once it is, go out and collect some gravel and wood. Keep in mind that you need food, so look for Pam's Harvestcraft gardens. (And save some of the vegetables for seeds!)

#Quest_3.Storage for days
gtnh.quest3.name=Storage for days
gtnh.quest3.desc=Now that you've unlocked 3x3 crafting, it's about time to make some storage for your goods. Take some of your wood, and craft a chest. You will need 4 wood, 4 planks and 1 flint.

#Quest_4.Crafting time
gtnh.quest4.name=Crafting time
gtnh.quest4.desc=It's time to get yourself a 3x3 crafting area. Grab some flint and some wood, and build one!

#Quest_5.Tools
gtnh.quest5.name=Tools
gtnh.quest5.desc=Now that you've got a shelter, crafting table and a place to store your items, you should make some tools. (Unless you'd like to continue punching trees with your bare hand...)

#Quest_6.You reap...
gtnh.quest6.name=You reap...
gtnh.quest6.desc=You won't always get food rewards from this book, so it might be a good idea to take care of that problem. As you've created a hoe already, go and find some water nearby and make a field. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your farm.

#Quest_7....what you sow
gtnh.quest7.name=...what you sow
gtnh.quest7.desc=If you, by chance, did read the previous quest and planted the carrot I gave you, then you're fine. Meanwhile, you should turn some more fruits and vegetables into seeds, and increase your farm to get a steady supply of food.

#Quest_8.Get that stone
gtnh.quest8.name=Get that stone
gtnh.quest8.desc=Look at you, with your shiny flint pickaxe! Time to mine some cobblestone. Yay! (And maybe you can improve this dirt-hut too...)

#Quest_9.Fire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.name=Fire, fire, Grandpa!
gtnh.quest9.desc=Time to burn some stuff, isn't it? You can't make charcoal in it, but you sure will find some usage for it soon(tm).

#Quest_10.Rest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.name=Rest in pieces
gtnh.quest10.desc=It's GLOPPing time! Go kill some pigs to gather meat. (And yes, they will drop cooked porkchop. Now if that isn't useful...)

#Quest_11.Sharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.name=Sharpness: Over... 5...
gtnh.quest11.desc=It's about time to craft some more useful stuff: A sword!

#Quest_12.Fluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.name=Fluffy and red
gtnh.quest12.desc=Epic quest: Kill some sheep! (And try to get some wool, for a bed, obviously...)

#Quest_13.SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.name=SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...
gtnh.quest13.desc=Sleepy time, and: The end of Tier 0. Congratulations, you've built yourself your first hideout, and you should have a steady supply of food by now. See you again in Tier 1!

#Quest_14.What is that...?
gtnh.quest14.name=What is that...?
gtnh.quest14.desc=You've seen a lot of trees, but there are a few that look really special. You are sure that these trees are more than just wood to build your home or get charcoal.

#Quest_15.Ready, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.name=Ready, set, go!
gtnh.quest15.desc=You probably should have a home by now. A steady supply of food is a fundamental requirement at all times. Take this journal to keep track of the things you've eaten, while you proceed. You will have to travel far in this Tier, better be prepared!

#Quest_16.Better Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.name=Better Tank... Iron Tank
gtnh.quest16.desc=Storing more than 16 Buckets of Fluids in one tank? Sure just make an iron Tank or upgrade the Buildcraft Tank.\nDiamond Tanks carry up to 64 Buckets and Obsidian ones are blast proof.

#Quest_17.Sand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.name=Sand: The Gathering
gtnh.quest17.desc=In a strange vision you saw a big structure which would allow you to make charcoal. Finally some torches! According to your calculations, you would need a lot of sand for that.

#Quest_18.Basic processing
gtnh.quest18.name=Basic processing
gtnh.quest18.desc=Most things are unavailable at the moment, so let's begin with something simple. Take some of your cobblestone and smelt it into regular stone. And because this modpack is evil, you'll need to use wood for that. How much fun is that?!

#Quest_19.Maceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.name=Maceration v0.1 Alpha
gtnh.quest19.desc=This fancy little device works (almost...) like a macerator. Some people say it's even better, since it does not require power, yay! You only need to craft one for this quest, but you probably should do some more if you can...

#Quest_20.Gravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.name=Gravel: The Gathering
gtnh.quest20.desc=Your tools will eventually lose durability. You think it would be a good idea to collect more gravel in order to provide yourself with flint for more tools.

#Quest_21.Clay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.name=Clay: The Gathering
gtnh.quest21.desc=While being bored, you thought that it might be a good idea to kill your time with pottery. You should go and find some clay, riverbanks should have some.

#Quest_22.Finite Water!?
gtnh.quest22.name=Finite Water!?
gtnh.quest22.desc=Finite water is a problem, that's for sure. But last night, you had an idea. If you can drink cacti, you should also be able to use it for most recipes that require water. How cool is that? So what about another trade; 10 wood for.. 3 cacti so you can setup a farm. Deal?

#Quest_23.Something to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.name=Something to carry liquids
gtnh.quest23.desc=You tried to move water with you bare hands, which didn't work at all. Luckily, you remember a way how to make a buckets out of clay.

#Quest_24.Getting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.name=Getting (char)coal
gtnh.quest24.desc=It's time to get yourself some charcoal. For that, we're going to build a coke oven. Good that you just collected a lot of resources! (What a coincidence...)

#Quest_25.Another brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.name=Another brick in the wall
gtnh.quest25.desc=Your vision becomes more clear, you'll need bricks for your first multiblock structure. You think that 104 bricks should be enough. However, the bricks you'll need are somewhat special. Pay attention to craft the correct ones!

#Quest_26.Forming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.name=Forming press v0.1
gtnh.quest26.desc=As you might have noticed, you cannot turn clay into bricks as usual. Well, to be fair, it wasn't a good recipe anyway. You'll probably end up with something bread-shaped. So in order to make bricks, you need a form. Get yourself a knife and a blank pattern, and cut a brick sized piece out. As easy as that.

#Quest_27.Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.name=Finally, some power
gtnh.quest27.desc=Now that you have a coke oven, you should start producing charcoal. The more, the better. Don't worry about the creosote oil; I have another deal for you...

#Quest_28.Copper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.name=Copper sky, Iron curtain
gtnh.quest28.desc=With your new acquired fuel source, you are now ready to process more advanced materials than stone or clay; Iron or copper, for example. Just in case you don't know, they spawn in rather large veins. Use the following quests to search and locate the most important veins you'll need.

#Quest_29.Another fuel source
gtnh.quest29.name=Another fuel source
gtnh.quest29.desc=Lignite and regular coal are the fuel sources you'll definitely need. The latter can be turned into coke, which is a superior material to smelt your first large batch of ore.

#Quest_30.Copper
gtnh.quest30.name=Copper
gtnh.quest30.desc=Can be found between 5 and 60 either as "Copper Ore" or "Chalcopyrite". Most of the time you'll find it together with  "Iron" and "Pyrite".

#Quest_31.Tin
gtnh.quest31.name=Tin
gtnh.quest31.desc=Found mostly in mountains, between Y level 60 and 220. Also the veins are a source of "Cassiterite".

#Quest_32.Book parts
gtnh.quest32.name=Book parts
gtnh.quest32.desc=After you've found a way to pick up and move around water, you had another brilliant idea: Paper! Usually made with sugarcane, which doesn't work any more (and is pretty weird anyway...). However, you will need a lot of wood to craft wood pulp, so better grab your axe and go choppin' some trees.

#Quest_33.Tinker-time
gtnh.quest33.name=Tinker-time
gtnh.quest33.desc=While using your flint tools is fun in terms of burning pigs and cows, they are not pretty good, and can't be repaired. You had an idea how to craft tools that could be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.

#Quest_34.Aluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.name=Aluminini...um...?
gtnh.quest34.desc=However it is spelled, you will need it. Mostly found on the surface. Try to search in rivers. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_35.Making bronze
gtnh.quest35.name=Making bronze
gtnh.quest35.desc=Now that you've found copper and tin, you should make yourself some bronze. Use your macer... mortar to grind up some copper and tin, and mix them together!

#Quest_36.Important tools
gtnh.quest36.name=Important tools
gtnh.quest36.desc=In order to craft even the basic machines, you'll need new tools. Most of them can be replaced by machines later. For now, you should make yourself familiar with each of their recipes, as you will need a lot of these tools, starting today.\n\nAlso your new tools can be used to make Railcraft water tanks, a quite useful thing considering the finite water feature.

#Quest_37.Getting iron
gtnh.quest37.name=Getting iron
gtnh.quest37.desc=With your new bronze tools, you are able to mine most of the Overworld ores. I think you already found iron or magnetite.  So bring me some ores and make some iron ingots out of them.

#Quest_38.Making better tools
gtnh.quest38.name=Making better tools
gtnh.quest38.desc=With aluminium and copper, you can create a pretty durable material "Aluminum Brass", which can be used to cast better tools. These can be used to mine some more advanced ores.\n\nBut first you need a smeltery. See the Multiblock Goals chapter in this book, or find smeltery blocks in a village nearby.

#Quest_39.Better storage
gtnh.quest39.name=Better storage
gtnh.quest39.desc=As crafting chests is a good idea for your basic items and goods, it is not for the vast amount of ores. You should build yourself some barrels in order to keep things organized.

#Quest_40.You shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.name=You shall proceed
gtnh.quest40.desc=As you've gathered and crafted all materials and tools you need for your basic steam machinery, you may now proceed to the next tier. Keep in mind that you'll need mountains of resources in order to craft even the simplest things, so you probably should stock up on all ores in this tier. But that's up to you.

#Quest_41.Don't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.name=Don't burn your fingers!
gtnh.quest41.desc=You have decided it's time to make some tasty pizza, but your fingers got burned badly. Reading an ancient cookbook you discover a magical item that would allow you to carry anything hot, even lava in a bucket.\n\nThe gloves have to be placed in the Baubles ring slots of Thaumcraft.

#Quest_42.Cow Tripper
gtnh.quest42.name=Cow Tripper
gtnh.quest42.desc=Before you had to kill some pigs and sheep to complete quests. Now it's time to kill some cows and hopefully get some leather. If you are lucky and get a cow trophy you may never need to kill another cow in the future.

#Quest_43.Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.name=Cotton, cotton and more cotton
gtnh.quest43.desc=You find out that cotton is very useful. You can make wool out of it (how you can do this seems magical). Strings can be made out of cotton, and some other useful items too. Make a small cotton plantation to get more of this useful stuff.

#Quest_44.Welcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.name=Welcome to Tier 1
gtnh.quest44.desc=Welcome and well done so far! This tier is all about your first machines, getting more stuff from your ores and making bronze ingots is more efficient.

#Quest_45.Multiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
gtnh.quest45.name=Multiblock Tanks... Railcraft Tanks
gtnh.quest45.desc=576 buckets of fluids... Enough to store all the creosote I made before. If this isn't enough I can make this tank bigger. The smallest tanks are 3x3x4 while the biggest are 9x9x8 blocks.

#Quest_46.More advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.name=More advanced alloys
gtnh.quest46.desc=Your smeltery does a great job in mixing metals into alloys, but it's not very efficient, and limited in its complexity. You need something new, so why not put your steam to some use? It might also come in handy when processing raw rubber.

#Quest_47.Upgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.name=Upgrade: High speed alloys
gtnh.quest47.desc=Like most machines, there is a more advanced version of the alloy smelter. Keep in mind that this machine uses a lot of steam, so you better get some more boilers first. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_48.A very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.name=A very important alloy
gtnh.quest48.desc=Basically the most important alloy (until you reach a higher tier) is without questioning, red alloy. Fortunately, you have an alloy smelter, so better grab some redstone and get yourself a handful of that.

#Quest_49.The hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.name=The hell is that?
gtnh.quest49.desc=In order to get more machines, you'll need pistons. But not those amateurish ones, you need special ones, and I shall guide you how to make those.

#Quest_50.Macerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.name=Macerator v1.0!
gtnh.quest50.desc=Finally you are able to get a device, that will replace your mortar. However, the "no-durability" feature of this device comes with a cost: You need 2 diamonds for the grinding heads.

#Quest_51.Extracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.name=Extracting stuff
gtnh.quest51.desc=As you'll need rubber later on in order to wrap wires into cables, you should get yourself a Steam Extractor. You can also use this machine to get more dyes from flowers, or process different fruits into juice.

#Quest_52.A clear view
gtnh.quest52.name=A clear view
gtnh.quest52.desc=Still living in your dirt/cobblestone bunker? What about some windows? Put some sand in your smeltery, and pour it into a casting basin to make clear glass. In order to use it for recipes, you have to macerate it and then smelt it in any furnace.

#Quest_53.Hammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.name=Hammer time v2
gtnh.quest53.desc=Using 6 ingots to craft a hammer seems to be pretty wasteful, as these tools use up durability. How nice would it be to have machine that does the same but without having durability? Guess what, there is one! And you should totally get one.

#Quest_54.Compressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.name=Compressing stuff
gtnh.quest54.desc=This rather simple device does a very important job: compressing stuff. As you are not able to get blocks just by pressing 9 ingots with your bare hands, it is also useful to do various additional tasks, for example making firm tofu.

#Quest_55.Upgrade: Better compressor
gtnh.quest55.name=Upgrade: Better compressor
gtnh.quest55.desc=An updated version of the Steam Compressor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_56.Upgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.name=Upgrade: Forge hammer
gtnh.quest56.desc=An updated version of the Steam Forge Hammer. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_57.Upgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.name=Upgrade: Extractor
gtnh.quest57.desc=An updated version of the Steam Extractor. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. You most probably want to craft this, as the extractor does also extract your nerves... (This quest is optional)

#Quest_58.Upgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.name=Upgrade: Better macerator
gtnh.quest58.desc=An updated version of the Steam Macerator. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_59.Steam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.name=Steam alternatives
gtnh.quest59.desc=There is more than one way to get steam for your machines. This completely optional quests shall show you some ways of getting steam.

#Quest_60.Upgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.name=Upgrade: Coal boiler
gtnh.quest60.desc=This is basically just an upgrade to your current coal boiler, however it produces more than twice as much steam. Something you should consider building if you're planning to get some of the machine upgrades.

#Quest_61.Another use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.name=Another use for Java, I mean Lava
gtnh.quest61.desc=With the more durable steel casings, you can now use lava to make steam.

#Quest_62.The power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.name=The power of the sun
gtnh.quest62.desc=The sun has quite a bit of power, so why not use it to produce steam?

#Quest_63.Using steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.name=Using steam to cook things
gtnh.quest63.desc=A rather slow process, but it's more efficient than using a regular furnace.

#Quest_64.Upgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.name=Upgrade: Better furnace
gtnh.quest64.desc=An updated version of the Steam Furnace. Uses more steam, but is almost twice as fast. (This quest is optional)

#Quest_65.Blastoff!
gtnh.quest65.name=Blastoff!
gtnh.quest65.desc=It's about time to make some steel. Look in the Multiblock Goals quest set and build a Bronze Blast Furnace. Return here when you made at least 8 steel ingots.

#Quest_66.Time for some logic
gtnh.quest66.name=Time for some logic
gtnh.quest66.desc=Good news is: You are now able to advance to the next tier! Bad news is: You still have to craft a lot of things before you can begin. But fear not mortal, I shall guide you!

#Quest_67.Wired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.name=Wired, weird?!
gtnh.quest67.desc=One of the very basic materials which you should memorize how to craft are wires and cables. Basically you just cut a plate into a wire with your wire cutter. Not very efficient, but there will be a better way later.

#Quest_68.Your first logic circuit
gtnh.quest68.name=Your first logic circuit
gtnh.quest68.desc=Where steam machines are kinda stupid and just do one thing again and again, as you advance into electrical age, you've decided that you want the machines to have more features, like auto-output in order to create some automation. For that, you need logic circuits.

#Quest_69.Wire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.name=Wire-Wrap
gtnh.quest69.desc=Placing wires without insulation seems to be a bad idea. Now that you have an extractor to extract raw rubber out of sticky resin and an alloy smelter to further process it using sulphur, you should work on getting some rubber sheets.

#Quest_70.Steam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.name=Steam-a-licious!
gtnh.quest70.desc=You almost made it. One last crafting step is required in order to advance to Tier 2. Keep going!

#Quest_71.Basic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.name=Basic crafting: Motors
gtnh.quest71.desc=Motors are little devices that can turn electrical power into rotational energy. Very useful for all kind of machines, and not that difficult to craft. The pattern is always the same, only the materials change with tiers.

#Quest_72.Basic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.name=Basic crafting: Rotors
gtnh.quest72.desc=Rotors are also crafted using identical pattern with different materials. Annoying to craft a bit at the moment, but you don't need a lot of them anyway.

#Quest_73.Basic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.name=Basic crafting: Casings
gtnh.quest73.desc=All machines need a hull to keep their private parts together. Good news is: They are crafted in the same way for every tier, only the materials change.

#Quest_74.You are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.name=You are not prepared!!!
gtnh.quest74.desc=It's time for something really big: A smeltery! There's a lot to craft, so better gather some resources...

gtnh.quest76.name=Time to get some steel
gtnh.quest76.desc=You need steel? Uhh... fine. Let's get busy...\n\n(Hint: The Bronze Blast Furnace can share walls with other ones, just like most GT multi blocks. How will this affect the air quality though...)

#Quest_77.EBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.name=EBF-Time
gtnh.quest77.desc=In order to get the proper alumin(i)um, you need an Electrical Blast Furnace. It's another very important step towards victory, so let's get started.\n\nGetting the heating coils might be tricky...\n\n(You need 2LV hatches with 4A LV total, or 3LV hatches with MOOOORE power if the multiblock is not fully fixed)

#Quest_78.Upgrade #1: More heat
gtnh.quest78.name=Upgrade #1: More heat
gtnh.quest78.desc=Better materials need higher temperatures. You can just exchange the old coils with the new ones. You can even recycle the old coils, how fancy is that!

#Quest_79.Upgrade #2: Higher tier
gtnh.quest79.name=Upgrade #2: Higher tier
gtnh.quest79.desc=To reach the 3600k heat capacity of your EBF, so you can process high-tier materials like tungsten, you need nichrome heating coils.

#Quest_80.Compress all the things
gtnh.quest80.name=Compress all the things
gtnh.quest80.desc=Martin's (DreamMasterXXL) favourite machine. Compress ALL the things! With explosives, of course.

#Quest_81.At the end of...
gtnh.quest81.name=At the end of...
gtnh.quest81.desc=...the universe everything freezes eventually. But waiting for the death of the universe might take too long. Therefore we present you the vacuum freezer. It should be good enough to cool your hot stuff.

#Quest_82.An unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.name=An unexpected Bonus
gtnh.quest82.desc=Because we're nice developers, we decided to add a little bonus if you happen to compress charcoal. Not only does it allow you to process more than 16 steel at a time (not in the Bronze Blast Furnace), it also yields 10x the burn time per block instead of 9x. So one charcoal for free. This bonus only occurs on the first compression step. (But for fanciness, you should definitely get a quintuple one!)

#Quest_83.High speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.name=High speed charcoal
gtnh.quest83.desc=Sure, those coke ovens are nice, but they aren't even remotely fast enough to keep up with a Large Steam Boiler. Luckily, there is an upgrade available! The creosote oil will not be produced, but the process will speed up dramatically. Who needs that nasty yellowish stuff anyway...

#Quest_84.Where I can put all the liquids in
gtnh.quest84.name=Where I can put all the liquids in
gtnh.quest84.desc=With your brand new alloy smelter you are able to combine two materials. What happens if you mix some obsidian dust and glass? Obsidian glass, great.

#Quest_85.Smelt all the things...
gtnh.quest85.name=Smelt all the things...
gtnh.quest85.desc=...with this great invention! Uses power to smelt up to 2 stacks of items at once! Can't go any faster! (Parallel smelting depends on coils, consult your doctor before use)

#Quest_86.Upgrade #3: Upgrade Tier 4
gtnh.quest86.name=Upgrade #3: Upgrade Tier 4
gtnh.quest86.desc=To process more advanced materials like: enderium, enriched naquadah or niobium-titanium you need more than 3600K. Upgrade your EBF... again.

#Quest_89.Tier 3
gtnh.quest89.name=Tier 3
gtnh.quest89.desc=In Tier 3, you will be able to craft your first actually "useful" machines. Basic ones do the job, but with MV, a lot more recipes will unlock. Your goal here is to set up stable ore processing for the vast amounts of materials you'll need later on. You also should focus on power production if you haven't already.

#Quest_90.Damn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.name=Damn you, wire cutter!
gtnh.quest90.desc=Enough is enough. No more wasting gazillions of ingots just for a couple of wires. Now that you have power, you should go for a wiremill!

#Quest_91.You gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.name=You gonna hate this #1
gtnh.quest91.desc=The first item you'll need a lot of. If you want to pull items out of chests or barrels you need one (Goes pretty well with item pipes or GT machines, adjust with screwdriver).

#Quest_92.You gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.name=You gonna hate this #4
gtnh.quest92.desc=The third item you'll need a lot of, and is also a pain to craft. Probably, the most painful item ever (Works like a conveyor but can work with selected item slots, adjust with screwdriver).

#Quest_93.You gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.name=You gonna hate this #2
gtnh.quest93.desc=The second item you'll need a lot of. When you want to get the fluid out of the tanks you need one (Goes pretty well with fluid pipes or GT machines, adjust with screwdriver. It can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed).

#Quest_94.Electric macerator
gtnh.quest94.name=Electric macerator
gtnh.quest94.desc=It is highly recommended to get one of these, as the efficiency in terms of coal/steam used to macerate something is a lot better when using EU.

#Quest_95.You gonna hate this #3

gtnh.quest96.name=Saving redstone
gtnh.quest96.desc=Tired of using 4 redstone for one magnetic iron rod? Well, good news for you! The polarizer doesn't need redstone, just a little bit of power. You don't need to attach this machine to a permanent power source, it runs fine on battery power.

#Quest_97.Avengers, assemble!
gtnh.quest97.name=Avengers, assemble!
gtnh.quest97.desc=An absolute must have for fans of the movie. Oh, and to make all the things, of course.

#Quest_98.No more filing
gtnh.quest98.name=No more filing

gtnh.quest101.name=Mjolnir!!! (Electric Forge Hammer)
gtnh.quest101.desc=Not really required, but it is a lot faster than the steam one and it can be automated. If you feel like ore washing is too slow use this hammer. There are no recipes that require anything more than steam level to hammer something.

#Quest_102.Cutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.name=Cutting things apart
gtnh.quest102.desc=An absolutely mandatory machine to have. It will cut rods into bolts, plates into casings, logs into planks, and of that will be done with the highest possible efficiency. Totally worth it!

gtnh.quest103.name=Get ready for Tier 3
gtnh.quest103.desc=In order to proceed forward, you need to get aluminium. A lot of it. But for now, one is enough to unlock this quest.

#Quest_108.Automated (un-)loading
gtnh.quest108.name=Automated (un-)loading

#Quest_109.Cart modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.name=Cart modules: Farming
gtnh.quest109.desc=Unfortunately, the basic farmer can't farm anything besides wheat. It's not expensive at all, and probably the cheapest solution to give your automated food production a boost.

#Quest_113.Basic transport pipe
gtnh.quest113.name=Basic transport pipe

gtnh.quest127.name=Project Red Begging
gtnh.quest127.desc=First of all there are 3 types of pipes: Null Logic, Pressurized and Routed.\n-Null Logic are the most basic kind. They can't have any logical thinking. Item transport pipes are of this category and they are used to craft and connect the routed and pressurized pipes. It would be a wise choice to craft some extras.\n \n-Routed pipes are the most advanced. They can communicate with each other in order to create pipe networks, and can be used for very complex tasks.\n \n-Pressurized pipes are too complicated to use and explain. You won't need them anyway since you can use the routed ones to do anything you want.\n\nHowever, in order to control the logic of the routed pipes you will need chips.

#Quest_128.Ender not-so-IO
gtnh.quest128.name=Ender not-so-IO

gtnh.quest216.name="Clean" energy..?
gtnh.quest216.desc=Finally, a reliable and powerful source of energy for your base. And why waste your time with a 2k generator? Go for a 8k one! (Hint: It's probably a good idea to wear your hazmat suit before claiming your reward...)

gtnh.quest217.name=Final choice: Void
gtnh.quest217.desc=Tired of mobs in your base? Want to build somewhere... different? Probably in a void dimension? Then this is your chance. But choose wisely; You can only pick one option.

gtnh.quest218.name=Final choice: Loot
gtnh.quest218.desc=Don't need a void dimension, eh? Well, then you'll probably be happy with some extra loot. Choose wisely; You can only pick one.

#Quest_219.Almost unbreakable
gtnh.quest219.name=Almost unbreakable
gtnh.quest219.desc=Probably not required any more, but you made so many walls. So why not to get the best ones?

#Quest_221.Turret base Tier 5
gtnh.quest221.name=Turret base Tier 5

#Quest_226.See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.name=See the unseen
gtnh.quest226.desc=Everything is made of 6 primal aspects. Those aspects can be combined to form compound aspects, but in the end, there are only 6. Like the infused shards you found. You noticed that those shards start to vibrate when you bring them next to something that is made of the respective aspect. Maybe you can create a device to actually "scan" items, and reveal their compounds? This could be very useful later on.

#Quest_227.Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.name=Tables to work on
gtnh.quest227.desc=Indeed, the idea with the bookshelf did work. Now you need a nice table to do some research on, and probably something to infuse items with vis while crafting. Maybe you should try to smite a table with your wand.

#Quest_228.Bloody Water
gtnh.quest228.name=Bloody Water
gtnh.quest228.desc=By sacrificing some blood to the water spirits, they'll grant you some of their precious element.

#Quest_229.Infused stones
gtnh.quest229.name=Infused stones
gtnh.quest229.desc=This whole place here is filled with magic. No matter where you look at, it's just everywhere. You wonder what happens to regular stone if it's exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it's time to go mining?

#Quest_230.Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.name=Your first wand
gtnh.quest230.desc=You are sure that this place will give you all the answers you are looking for! To continue, you need something to handle the magic energy called "Vis". Guess it's time to craft your first wand.

#Quest_231.Tome of knowledge
gtnh.quest231.name=Tome of knowledge
gtnh.quest231.desc=All the things you've discovered so far, you need to write them down. But you are lazy, and you have a wand, so why not try a magical way to "write down" your research? You wonder if you could enchant a book with your wand, so that it will keep track of your progress... You should try that on a bookshelf!

#Quest_232.Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.name=Improving your wand
gtnh.quest232.desc=Your wand does a great job in storing and releasing vis as you please. However, those iron caps are... Weak. If you don't pay enough attention to it, it might hurt the node. Maybe you should try to improve it with caps made out of a more valuable material. Like.. gold, perhaps?

#Quest_233.Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.name=Getting shards
gtnh.quest233.desc=Now that you found all 6 primal types of infused stone, you need to break those up in order to get the shards. The easiest way to do that, is to throw these stones in your Forge Hammer.

#Quest_234.A "greater" Wand
gtnh.quest234.name=A "greater" Wand
gtnh.quest234.desc=While doing all your research and mining of these infused stones, you had an idea how to actually use the wood of a Greatwood tree to make a new wand. Actually, it turned out to be pretty simple, but you lacked one important thing back then: Vis!. The vis makes sure the wood doesn't lose it's magic conductivity while forming the rod.

#Quest_235.Better screws
gtnh.quest235.name=Better screws
gtnh.quest235.desc=Unfortunately, your aluminium screws don't work with the greatwood rod. Somehow, the wood seems to repel the material. Luckily, you already have a Blast Furnace, so you can get a better material than aluminium.

#Quest_236.A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.name=A more powerful "scale"
gtnh.quest236.desc=The Naga scales are weak, they can only hold a very limited amount of Vis. You need a better, more powerful component to store Vis in your wand. You've heard rumors about an evil wizard in the Twilight forest. Maybe he has... something... that can be used?

#Quest_237."Stores 50 Vis" Wand
gtnh.quest237.name="Stores 50 Vis" Wand
gtnh.quest237.desc=Now combine your new wand, and be more powerful than before! You have a feeling, that this new wand will come in handy very soon(tm)

#Quest_238.Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.name=Fuuuuuu...(sion)!
gtnh.quest238.desc=Your arcane table does a great job with infusing primal vis into items while crafting. However, you feel that there must be more. What if you could infuse items with all kinds of magic aspects? The possibilities are endless...

#Quest_239.Yet another brick in the wall...
gtnh.quest239.name=Yet another brick in the wall...

#Quest_241.Not for soup
gtnh.quest241.name=Not for soup

#Quest_242.Balanced shards sdrahs decnalaB
gtnh.quest242.name=Balanced shards sdrahs decnalaB
gtnh.quest242.desc=By combining all 6 primal aspects in a crucible, you are able to make balanced shards. They can be ground up into "Salis Mundus", an absolutely crucial thing to have, trust me!

#Quest_243.Crystal clusters
gtnh.quest243.name=Crystal clusters
gtnh.quest243.desc=You, as a Thaumaturge, like shiny things. And what could be more shiny than a cluster made of those shards? You totally should get one of each.

gtnh.quest244.name=The choice: Ignis
gtnh.quest244.desc=In exchange for 2 clusters, I will give you this node. May it serve you well. Oh, don't place it too close to another node, or it might start to drain vis...

#Quest_245.The choice...
gtnh.quest245.name=The choice...
gtnh.quest245.desc=By now, you should've collected a few (or a lot) of locations for aura nodes to get vis from. You  might also have noticed, that you probably are low on a certain aspect, like ordo or ignis. Well, good news. In exchange for some crystal clusters, I will give you one of my old nodes. They are all pale, but they will help you out. You may only choose one, so think twice before you make your decision.

gtnh.quest251.name=Not just for decoration
gtnh.quest251.desc=Sure, they look pretty, but they serve a much more important purpose: Channeling vast amounts of vis and essentia. This might be useful soon(tm).

#Quest_252.This is the end...
gtnh.quest252.name=This is the end...
gtnh.quest252.desc=...of your apprenticeship. You have mastered all 6 primal aspects, you mastered the weak and strong infusion of essentia and vis, and you've already made your adept wand. But be warned, young one. The further you progress, the more darkness, and evil will tempt you to follow the forbidden ways of magic. I have seen things... weather changing, random teleportation, or even a Wither spawning right next to someone. Be careful, my friend...

#Quest_253.Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.name=Turning liquids into essentia
gtnh.quest253.desc=What a simple idea. So many people wasted tons of buckets just to get aqua from water, or sano from milk. Why didn't they just dissolve the liquid itself? Stupid ones...

#Quest_254.Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.name=Essentia filtering
gtnh.quest254.desc=This nifty little device will filter out essentia. Once it has received a single unit of any type, it will only accept this type until it is completely empty. How convenient. You can place more than one on top of an alchemical furnace.

#Quest_255.An alternative to torches
gtnh.quest255.name=An alternative to torches
gtnh.quest255.desc=And lava! It's an excellent heat source.

#Quest_256.Not coal
gtnh.quest256.name=Not coal
gtnh.quest256.desc=Way better. To be fair, it's a waste to use coal itself, but it also works with charcoal and lignite dust. And it speeds up the dissolving of items in an alchemical furnace.

#Quest_257.Save the squids, we must
gtnh.quest257.name=Save the squids, we must
gtnh.quest257.desc=A very convenient way to make PETA activists happy and get ink at the same time. (Hint: The essentia in those roses might be useful...)

#Quest_261.An awesome magic conductor
gtnh.quest261.name=An awesome magic conductor

gtnh.quest263.name=It doesn't work
gtnh.quest263.desc=I tried to combine the lich bones I had with this new wand rod. The result: A pile of ashes. It crumbled to dust within seconds. I need a better conductor. The hydra in the twilight forest has the ability to regrow an entire head! Her blood must contain a large amount of magic. I guess I need a bit of that for my next wand.

#Quest_264.Obsidian Rod
gtnh.quest264.name=Obsidian Rod
gtnh.quest264.desc=By using obsidian and some earth clusters, I'm able to create a magical infused rod, that will slowly recharge its own terra vis.

#Quest_265.Creating a better wand
gtnh.quest265.name=Creating a better wand
gtnh.quest265.desc=This greatwood wand is nice, but it can only store 50 vis. Not enough to move nodes. My tries to use silverwood failed, but I've come across other mundane materials that I could use to make a new wand core.

#Quest_266.More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.name=More durable screws
gtnh.quest266.desc=Those stainless steel screws don't work on these rods. Due to the huge amounts of vis those wands can carry, the screws somehow "melt" away. I need a more durable material. I guess I will try titanium.

gtnh.quest267.desc=By using nether quartz and some order clusters, I'm able to create a magical infused rod, that will slowly recharge its own ordo vis.

#Quest_275.Centi-Vis
gtnh.quest275.name=Centi-Vis
gtnh.quest275.desc=Many advanced machines require vis in order to do what they're supposed to. But using a wand as some sort of battery to transfer vis from a node to your machine didn't work as expected. What if you could rip open a node?

#Quest_276.Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.name=Bring it home
gtnh.quest276.desc=You probably have a nice collection of bookmarked nodes. But running around to recharge your wand(s) isn't really the way an adept thaumaturge should get his required vis. Moving nodes is not that hard, but without doubt, you need something to protect them from each other.

#Quest_277.Automated wand-recharge
gtnh.quest277.name=Automated wand-recharge
gtnh.quest277.desc=So you found a way to gather nodes now. What about automated wand recharge? Wouldn't that be extremely convenient?

gtnh.quest279.desc=We found the way... my precious. We found it! Only need 4 tasty eyes, and some magic to open the door. The secret door, they didn't see it. Hehehe! All the time. It was there... Aaaall the time!

#Quest_287.What could possibly go wrong?
gtnh.quest287.name=What could possibly go wrong?
gtnh.quest287.desc=256 essentia in one block! Now that is what I call storage. Does make weird sounds, but I guess it's nothing special...

#Quest_288.Let's try this
gtnh.quest288.name=Let's try this
gtnh.quest288.desc=Mortals. Pah. What do they know about REAL power. The voices tell me I need to focus on alienis and tenebrae if I want to advance. So what about food?

gtnh.quest289.name=An appropriate weapon

#Quest_342.Nimbus 1999
gtnh.quest342.name=Nimbus 1999

#Quest_350.A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.name=A few more things...
gtnh.quest350.desc=Ok, I think I have everything I need to assemble the device. Can you assist me with some additional materials? I need to update most of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged most of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.\n\nMost of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.\n\nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?\n\nDo you see that pile of chrome over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?\n\nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?

#Quest_351.Hello there
gtnh.quest351.name=Hello there
gtnh.quest351.desc=I've observed your pathway, and I have to say, I'm impressed. I might need your help soon, on a big project of mine.

#Quest_352.Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.name=Power. So much power!
gtnh.quest352.desc=If I could only use it... Well, hi there my friend. I need your help with a project of mine. I want to create an immense power source, but I have a few problems that I need to solve first. Will you help me? You shall be rewarded.

#Quest_353.A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.name=A problem that matters
gtnh.quest353.desc=I need to open a wormhole. But for that, I need an immense gravitational field. One like those created upon the death of a star. But I can't really "kill" a sun for this. I need to compress matter somehow... \nBut... How?

#Quest_354.Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.name=Now that matters!
gtnh.quest354.desc=Of course! The matter condenser! How come I didn't think of that?

#Quest_355.I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.name=I need a stabilizer
gtnh.quest355.desc=Opening the wormhole is one thing, but I need to stabilize it, so it doesn't harm anything. I guess I need something made of crystal. Why? Because I like it fancy. Find me a crystal-based, transparent material with immense power, would you?

#Quest_356.Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.name=Shiny!
gtnh.quest356.desc=What in the world is this? This is amazing! I need more of these! They will be an amazing containment material for the wormhole!

#Quest_357.I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.name=I'm hungry
gtnh.quest357.desc=What... I work a lot! So get me some food please.

#Quest_358.It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.name=It needs a power plug...
gtnh.quest358.desc=Given the fact that I will be able to craft this device, it needs some kind of "plug" to get the power out. I need something to conduct immense amounts of power. I thought about superconductors, but they don't fit with the crystal casing material I have in mind. I need 2 different crystals, one for positive and one for negative charge.

#Quest_359.Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.name=Red and blue
gtnh.quest359.desc=Really? A red and blue crystal? How awesome is that! I think I will need 8 of each color, just to be sure.

#Quest_360.A casing
gtnh.quest360.name=A casing
gtnh.quest360.desc=I need something for the outer shell. Again, a crystal-based material, because I like it shiny. I tested all crystals we know, and none of them meet the requirements. I heard you have access to the space? Can you try to find a suitable material while you're out there?

#Quest_361.Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.name=Fancy!
gtnh.quest361.desc=Yes. Yes! That's it. Bring me more of this stuff! I probably need a lot of it...

#Quest_362.Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.name=Beyond imagination
gtnh.quest362.desc=What is this? Draconium dust? I wonder if I could use this for something...

#Quest_363.The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.name=The power of dragons
gtnh.quest363.desc=Hey my friend. I got your sample, and I have to say, I'm amazed. This material has a lot of potential, but it's useless at the moment. I have an idea how to turn this into something useful, but I need you to help me with a few problems first.\n\nI need a good handful of that stuff for my research. Please get me some.

#Quest_364.A hull
gtnh.quest364.name=A hull
gtnh.quest364.desc=First things first, we need a hull. I played around with your sample, and it seems that it reacts with every known material. It even attacks Iridium! It's completely harmless if it's in a box that is open, but as soon as I try to enclose it in something, poof. It breaks free. We need something stronger than iridium my friend.

#Quest_365.Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.name=Dense, denser, Neutronium
gtnh.quest365.desc=Now look at this. This stuff is incredibly dense. Maybe this material will be sufficient?\n\nThis looks promising. Send me some samples, and I will try my luck.

#Quest_366.Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.name=Not a planet
gtnh.quest366.desc=This place is interesting. Maybe I should try to find new materials here...

#Quest_367.Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.name=Successful.. Or not?
gtnh.quest367.desc=Heh, neutronium. I didn't even know such a thing really exists. Unfortunately, the draconium dust was enclosed for... 5 seconds? But, it was a small success. \n\nOk let's travel to some planets and moons and look for the new material. I think we have to fly very far away for it.

#Quest_368.Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.name=Black Plutonium
gtnh.quest368.desc=This doesn't seem to be dense, but it's a material you haven't seen before. Maybe this could be the solution?\n\nBlack what? Huh, interesting. Send me some samples, I want to analyse it.

#Quest_369.We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.name=We have a hull
gtnh.quest369.desc=Surprisingly, this material is able to contain the draconium dust. It could be the radiation. Good job my friend!

#Quest_370.Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.name=Draconium Dust core
gtnh.quest370.desc=I've created a first sample of what I shall call "Draconium Dust core". Not quite the result I expected to be honest, but see for yourself.

#Quest_371.We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.name=We need to control it
gtnh.quest371.desc=The problem is, that the immense power of this dust is released all at once. We need something to control the vast amount of energies. I noticed that the dust starts to glow when it gets near an aura node. Maybe Thaumaturgy has the solution?

#Quest_372.The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.name=The power of primals
gtnh.quest372.desc=What else could control energies better than a focus of crystallized primal energy? With this little item, it should be possible to control the energies released from the dust.

#Quest_373.Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.name=Unforeseen consequences
gtnh.quest373.desc=You haven't heard anything in a while from the technician. You have a feeling that something might have gone terrible wrong, so you went to his place to investigate. What you found was... nothing. A void. It seems that he tried to combine the pearl with the dust. What did he say? The dust reacts to aura nodes? Of course it does. It amplifies the energies by a thousand times. And giving it raw primal energy, good lord, what has he done. May he rest in peace...

#Quest_374.I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.name=I'm on my own now
gtnh.quest374.desc=I need to continue my research. I still think that this primordial pearl is the key to control the dust, but I'm not sure how. Maybe the pearl is just too strong? I should try to use something that's similar, but less powerful. It reacts to vis, so maybe.. I should try to make a wand focus with that pearl. That way, I could channel vis into the dust without actually combining both.

#Quest_375.An interesting Material
gtnh.quest375.name=An interesting Material
gtnh.quest375.desc=This metal has quite interesting properties. It seems, that it has absorbed some of the energy that exists in the End. While ender pearls are quite fragile, this metal is a lot more durable. However, the absorbed energy is not enough to teleport things around. But you might find a solution for this.

#Quest_376.Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.name=Gross, what is that...
gtnh.quest376.desc=It's purple, and it smells like rotten eggs. But while staring at this unpleasant fluid, you had an idea. You can't reach the dust directly, but can you actually teleport something in and out the field? Might be worth a try.

#Quest_377.An Appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.name=An Appropriate focus
gtnh.quest377.desc=You've tried a lot, and nothing was quite enough to activate the dust. Until now. You finally found a focus that is able to transmit enough power to cause a heavy reaction with the dust, but not enough to cause problems.

#Quest_378.Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.name=Activated draconium dust
gtnh.quest378.desc=At least for a short period of time. The wand focus is powerful enough to activate the dust, but it will convert back to regular dust as soon as I stop feeding it with vis. If I only could contain it, surround it with a forcefield...

#Quest_379.The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.name=The strongest forcefield
gtnh.quest379.desc=In order to create a forcefield, I need to build myself a containment device. I will use only the best emitters I can afford. I will take no risks here.

#Quest_380.Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.name=Not what I expected...
gtnh.quest380.desc=The outcome was... interesting. It did not explode, instead, the activated draconium dust generated a counter-field to mine! Unfortunately, the emitters could not stand the reverse energies, and melted. I was able to shut it off quick enough to save the machine casing (At least what's left from it...) And a couple of field generators.

#Quest_381.Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.name=Forcefield, second try
gtnh.quest381.desc=I came to the following conclusion: Draconium dust seems to react nicely with all kinds of magic energy, and seems to repel technology. So I need to find a way to create a forcefield with magic alone. There must be a way...

#Quest_382.A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.name=A magic force field
gtnh.quest382.desc=While node stabilizers are too weak, you found a way to generate a strong containment field, generated by magic itself. You tried to use warded glass, but even the "frozen in spacetime" material could not resist the power of activated draconium dust. You decided to build another device, this time with your newest invention.\n\nThe vortex attenuator is powerful enough to negate even hungry nodes, and it also will be able to contain activated draconium dust.\n\nJust to be sure, I will add some amplifiers to it.

#Quest_383.What the...?
gtnh.quest383.name=What the...?
gtnh.quest383.desc=The device works! It is able to fully contain and separate the draconium dust from everything around it! Unfortunately... It also prevents the vis from passing the barrier, which results in regular draconium dust... In a forcefield...

#Quest_384.Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.name=Looking for alternatives
gtnh.quest384.desc=It is frustrating. Either you are able to contain the dust but can't activate it, or, you activate it and it causes serious damage. Maybe you need to find answers somewhere else.\n\nDraconic... Like... Dragon?

#Quest_385.Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.name=Draconic... Like... Dragon?
gtnh.quest385.desc=Maybe you where looking for the right things in the wrong place. As this dust obviously origins from dragons, the best thing to do now is to find answers in the dimension of dragons: The End.

#Quest_386.Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.name=Weird creatures
gtnh.quest386.desc=These ghosts are weird beings. But, I found this ectoplasm, which, by itself, seems to be pretty useless.

#Quest_387.Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.name=Activated teleport power
gtnh.quest387.desc=By a random guess of yours, you combined molten ender pearls and a few more of these shards with an empty gem, and it turned blue. It is pulsating with power. You tried to use it on your containment device, and it seems to be able to bypass the force field, while keeping it intact that the same time. Sadly, it doesn't have enough power to let vis pass through. Maybe you can even further increase the gems power?

#Quest_388.Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.name=Arcane shards
gtnh.quest388.desc=While the normal world is based on vis and primal energy, the End seems to be quite different. This arcane shard is the crystallized form of this energy, just like the primal shards that you used so many times in the past. By pure randomness, you discovered that it reacts with the metal you've found.

#Quest_389.Draconic Evolution
gtnh.quest389.name=Draconic Evolution
gtnh.quest389.desc=After a long and tedious path, you finally managed to create a device that is able to activate draconium dust, trap it in spacetime, and make use of the vast energies it emits while activated. The result is a perfectly stabilized core, that is completely harmless by itself, but is also able to provide incredible amounts of power on demand.

#Quest_390.Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.name=Balanced thaumium
gtnh.quest390.desc=This new metal is quite cheap, and has an awesome conductivity towards all 6 primal aspects. Regarding the capsule, I'd say it is a superconductor for vis. I think I can finally assemble the final frame.

#Quest_391.Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.name=Automated evolution
gtnh.quest391.desc=The machine is working pretty well, but it's tedious to fill in the reagents manually. But you have an idea, you could use a few basic components to fully automate the process.\n\nYou can use robot arms and conveyor belts to automate the input and output.\n\nObviously, you need to power the machines. A solar panel will do just fine.\n\nIn order to automate the catalyst, you need a few things. One golem will gather basic materials, while the second one will hunt creepers and ghasts for the more valuable ingredients.\n\nYou found a way to re-use the singularity, so you only need to get some sand. Luckily, the golem that works on the catalyst will be able to get glass too. He just needs a little additional motivation.\n\nYour golems need light, obviously. Also, it would be nice if there are some signal lamps that indicate the status of the process. Would it not?

#Quest_392.Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.name=Activated teleport gem
gtnh.quest392.desc=You are sure that you've just discovered the solution for your containment problem. This gem happily transmits vis on request, while keeping the containment field intact. What a great day!

#Quest_393.You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.name=You did it! But...
gtnh.quest393.desc=Now that you are able to contain the activated draconium dust for an infinite amount of time, you where able to assure the energy it releases. The readings are incredible. You have never seen such a power before. The only problem is, the machinery required to keep the dust in this state is too large to use it for crafting.\n\nYou noticed something that might help: The dust reacts to vis, but it needs a lot of it, therefore you require the animation focus. If you could find a catalyst, that you can mix the dust with, you could make the dust react with the vis from its surroundings instead of a direct beam.

#Quest_394.A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.name=A catalyst
gtnh.quest394.desc=That's it. This catalyst contains all primal energies in a quite different form, a lot weaker than any node. However, in combination with the draconium dust, it amplifies the vis that's around it, which leads to a permanent activation. It still needs to be contained, but you don't need the direct vis beam any more.\n\nThe result is a compound, which still emits massive amounts of power, but is less destructive. It still attacks the neutronium, but I think if I can find a capsule-like container that has special properties, I could create a portable version of it.

#Quest_395.Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.name=Bulma would be proud
gtnh.quest395.desc=By combining a dimensional singularity with some glass cylinders and molten gold, I was able to create a miniature containment field within a very small area. Interesting enough, the new draconium blend amplifies the containment field from the inside. Once I fill the blend in the capsule, it immediately "seals" itself. I won't be able to remove or replace the dust any more, but I don't think I have to...\n\n\nThe perfect vessel for massive power!

#Quest_396.The final steps
gtnh.quest396.name=The final steps
gtnh.quest396.desc=Now that I've found a way to stabilize the draconium dust and keep it safe in a small capsule, I just need to make a small container for it, so I can drain the energy on demand. Neutronium will serve very well, but I need a magic conductor. Thaumium works, but gets way too hot and void metal has a bad conductivity. I need to find a magic alloy that is more "balanced" in terms of primal aspects

#Quest_397.Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.name=Endless evolution
gtnh.quest397.desc=Using your machine, you can now craft infinite amounts of these cores. And since it would be gruesome to let your golem work just for one single core, you decided to only request cores in a large batch of 16. How nice of you.

#Quest_398.Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.name=Kill Baba Yaga
gtnh.quest398.desc=Baba Yaga is a witch (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name), who appears as a deformed and/or ferocious-looking elderly woman. She flies around in a mortar and wields a pestle. She dwells deep in the forest, in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs, with a fence decorated with human skulls. Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter or seek her out.

#Quest_399.Kill Horned Huntsman
gtnh.quest399.name=Kill Horned Huntsman
gtnh.quest399.desc=A Horned Huntsman is a member of the Wild Hunt, a powerful entity created by the Horned God. If one is encountered, prepare for a hard fight, or better flee.

#Quest_400.Kill Ender Dragon
gtnh.quest400.name=Kill Ender Dragon
gtnh.quest400.desc=The dragon must die. Long enough he destroyed those precious endstone blocks!

#Quest_401.Kill Shade of Leonard
gtnh.quest401.name=Kill Shade of Leonard
gtnh.quest401.desc=Leonard is the demonic being who is rumored to have taught a cadre of German witches their trade, and often presided over their sabbats. A skilled coven with the witches cauldron can summon a Shade of the Demon according to the method described in the Witches' Brews book.

#Quest_402.Kill Lord of Tormentum
gtnh.quest402.name=Kill Lord of Tormentum
gtnh.quest402.desc=A Lord of Torment is a mighty demonic being that is able to create prisons to Torment its victims. Those foolish enough to summon one of these creatures must prepare for an arduous fight.

#Quest_403.Kill Mog and Gulg
gtnh.quest403.name=Kill Mog and Gulg
gtnh.quest403.desc=Mog and Gulg are the god-like beings that Hobgoblins worship. They may send their avatars to pay witches a visit who exploit their worship (with a Statue of Hobgoblin Patron). Rumor has it that using a nether star may make them take immediate notice.

#Quest_404.Kill Demon
gtnh.quest404.name=Kill Demon
gtnh.quest404.desc=Demons are powerful, evil beings who dwell in the infernal dimensions. To date, none have been seen roaming the Nether, where their minions: ghasts, blazes and their ilk seem to dominate. To meet a demon without a way to protect oneself is almost certain death. They are known to hit like a proverbial truck, and require a significant amount of damage to kill. Some demons have even been seen shooting fireballs! They are, of course, also immune to fire.

gtnh.quest737.name=Can u eat those? 
gtnh.quest737.desc=No you can't eat them but you can add them to your routed pipes. Without chips routed pipes can't do anything on their own, chips also have a GUI to configure them wich can be opened by right clicking. \nThere are 8 types of chips:\n\n-Item extractor chip can be used to send items from its inventory to responder, dynamic responder, terminator and overflow responder chips in a pipe network. \n\n-Item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network wich match the filter configured to the inventory connected to the responder chip. Chips with higher priority value will receive items first until the inventory is full then will be sent to other inventories with valid filters and remaining space.\n\n-Dynamic item responder chip will request items from the extractor chips in your network that match items inside the dynamic item responder connected inventory. This chip has to be in the same interface pipe as the item responder chip in order to work. Priority rules apply here as well. \n\n-Item overflow responder works exactly the same as the item responder chip, however it only accepts items that cannot go to an item responder chip, dynamic item responder chip, or item terminator chip. \n\n-Item terminator chip works as a backup for responder chips.\n\n-Item broadcaster chip will show you the inventory connected to the routed request pipe on the pipe network and can be used to retrieve items from it. They can also extract for wich side you configure them. \n\n-Item stock keeper chip will constantly check the network for items and pull them to its pipe. If the chip is set to pull when empty, it will only pull if the inventory next to it is empty, otherwise it will pull when there are less items in the inventory than configured in the chip.\n\n-Item crafting chips craft things. \n\n-Item crafting extension chips are placed inside the item crafting chips. Make sure you randomize the id.

#Quest_738.Routed Pipes

gtnh.quest739.desc=Now that you are familiar with the mod it's time to organize items in your base a bit. These are the things you need in order to get a basic extract/insert system.\n\nFirst of all you will need a drawer controller. You can pick it from here or craft it yourself and place it down. Next to it add as much drawers as you want, and make sure they are touching each other or the controller.\n\nThe next step is to connect a routed interface pipe to your drawer controller. Take the item responder chip and configure it to filter mode: blacklist (this will allow you to get any items from your system) and add the chip to the routed interface pipe by right clicking on it. Don't forget the dynamic item responder.\n\nIn order to allow your system to be able to see items you need to add the item broadcast chip TO THE SAME ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE WICH IS CONNECTED TO THE DRAWER CONTROLLER.\n\nThe last step is to connect a routed request pipe IN THE SAME NETWORK AS THE ROUTED INTERFACE PIPE and right click it to acess the GUI. You can only extract items from it. In order to insert items simply right click them on the drawer controller. \n\nYou can find more complex tutorials on youtube for autocrafting.
